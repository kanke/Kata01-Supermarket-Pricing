# QMetric Java Exercise

Our Java coding exercise is inspired by [PragDave Supermaket Kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/). 
 
> [...] to experiment with various models for representing money and prices that are flexible enough to deal with [a variety of] pricing schemes, and at the same time are generally usable (at the checkout, for stock management, order entry, and so on). 

## The task
  
Your task is to write _a component_ that can calculate the __total amount__ to pay for a _supermarket basket_. 

The products added to a supermarket basket can be priced _by unit_ or _by weight_.
 
The supermarket would like to offer _pricing discount_ schemes, for example:
- Buy one, get one free
- Buy two items for Â£1
- Buy three items for the price of two
  
First and foremost this is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your _software design_ skills within a small problem space. 

Please read through the description carefully and implement a solution that includes __at least one__ of the pricing discount schemes described.

We would like you spend __no more than one hour__ on this task. 
We have provided this outline Maven project with a simple model for you to use and refactor as you feel appropriate. 
The rest is up to you.
 
### We are looking for...

- Clean, tidy, tested, and __working__ code (with accurate pricing calculations) 
- Use of appropriate design patterns and [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles
- Small incremental changes with good comments, as demonstrated in your commit history

**Above all, we would rather see a small codebase with fewer features than failure to observe the points above.**

You may add any libraries you feel are appropriate.
But we don't expect to see databases or other persistence layers, dependency injection frameworks, web servers, REST APIs, or web frameworks;
we are **not** looking for a fully functioning supermarket system!

### Tips

- Plan your time before you start coding. Start small and add features incrementally
- Focus on the pricing model and the behaviour of your components -- you only need to demonstrate that your design works, rather than an exhaustive model of numerous supermarket items 
- If you run out of time, describe your intentions in the [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) file

We really don't want you to over-engineer the solution -- and you really don't have time for that! -- but be prepared to extend the functionality in the next step of the interview process. 

## Submission

Clone or fork this project into a _publicly accessible_ git repository of your own, and email the URL to to [tpadberg@qmetric.co.uk](mailto:tpadberg@qmetric.co.uk). 

Good Luck!
